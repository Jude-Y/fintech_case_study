## Overview and Origin

Bitfarms Limited owns and operates a number of large computing centres that power the global decentralized financial economy. In particular, Bitfarms operates five computing centres across Quebec, Canada. Further, the company provides computing power to cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin where it earns fees from each network for securing and processing transactions. 
 
Bitfarms began its operations in 2017. The company was established by Mathieu Vachon, Emiliano Grodzki and Nicolas Bonta. The company's management team and capital market professionals focus on developing the most efficient ecosystem in relation to blockchain-based technologies. 


## Business Activities
 

Bitfarms provides essential services centered on validating and verifying global cryptocurrency transactions. The company utilizes a myriad of 4-inch fans and compact sized computers to crack mathematical equations. For instance, when an equation is solved, the computer is rewarded with bitcoins. The computer then moves on to another equation to solve and then another. Bitfarms intends to use blockchain, bitcoin's underlying virtual ledger, as a backbone to host authentication, logistics and payment systems for companies and individuals. The company’s future plans will further explore and leverage the use of blockchain technology. 
 
In terms of its financials, Bitfarms has raised a total of $40.7 million in funding, which includes two lead investors. (Dominion Capital & DC BFL SPV - is an affiliate of Dominion Capital)




## Landscape


Bitfarms operates in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain.
 
In recent years, blockchain technology has had an impact on many industries and has disrupted normal ways of doing business. This has been compounded by the rise of digitization as more and more businesses have made their services available online. For example, some businesses are now incorporating blockchain technology to trace and or track their product routes from its origin.  
 
Major companies in this domain include: Riot blockchain, Hut 8 Mining, Marathon patent group, to name a few.
 


## Results


Bitfarms is responsible for mining about one per cent of all the Bitcoin mined globally each day, hauling an average of six or more bitcoins per day. 

Bitfarms hashrate is 965 PH/s which is higher in comparison to some of their peers, Hut 8 mining corp., and Riot Blockchain ending December 2020. Bitfarm anticipates 1205 PH/s ending hashrate Q1 2021. 

The company has mined more bitcoins than its peers during the nine month ending september 30, 2020 with an industry leading average cost per bitcoin $5,300.



## Recommendations

There have been concerns around the high consumption of electricity by Bitfarms that is needed to power their data centres. Hydro Quebec has expressed that the company is using electricity that is “enough to power 25,000 homes” so in that case, it would be imperative to make a recommendation that would help them to lower their electricity use, which will help the environment and is sustainable in the long-term. 

My recommendation would be to install solar panels that can be used to reduce the usage of  hydroelectricity. 

This can reduce the cost that are associated with electricity and can take away the negative attention that they have been receiving from the media and hydro quebec.
